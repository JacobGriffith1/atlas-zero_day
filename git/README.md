My first readme

I updated it because it told me to.

This whole thing seems a bit silly, really. I've done all this work before,
and now I have to redo it because I was sick. Frankly, I don't see the point;
after all, I've made it this far. To be able to hold my own a fifth of the way
through this program, I obviously have to understand the fundementals. And yet
here I am, about to have to request an instructor to review my work and update
the grade- which would have been perfectly fine if not for being turned in
late due to sickness.

I understand that things must all be done according to protocol, but this
feels like a meaningless rework of material that in actuality was fine.
Perhaps this is a flaw of the system- that the separation of student and
instructor leaves a lack of understanding circumstances.

I'm going to redo every bit of this first little chunk, but know this:

It has all been done before, and it was fine then too.
